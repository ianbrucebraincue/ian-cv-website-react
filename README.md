# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website. This project showcases my work and experience. It’s a space where I highlight the projects I’ve worked on and the technologies I use.

Explore this site to learn more about me, my projects, and the skills I bring to the table.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Here's how you can run and interact with the codebase.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
The build is optimized for best performance, and the app is ready to be deployed.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!  
If you need full control over the build tools and configurations, you can run this command. Proceed with caution, as this is for advanced use cases.
